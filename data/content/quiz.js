    summary:
      'Vata is the force of movement — governing breath, circulation, nerve impulses, and the flow of thought. Vata types are naturally creative, quick-minded, and enthusiastic, but can drift toward anxiety, dryness, and scattered energy when out of balance. Grounding, warmth, and regular routine are your medicine.',

    summary:
      'Pitta is the force of transformation — governing digestion, metabolism, intelligence, and drive. Pitta types are naturally focused, ambitious, and articulate, but can move toward irritability, inflammation, and perfectionism when excess heat builds. Cooling down, softening effort, and embracing imperfection are your medicine.',
    constitution:
      'Your constitution is naturally warm, sharp, and intense. You are driven and transformation-focused, and your best balance comes from cooling ease, relaxed repetition, and gentle flexibility rather than perfection.',

      'Kapha is the force of cohesion — governing structure, lubrication, immunity, and emotional steadiness. Kapha types are naturally patient, loving, and resilient, but can accumulate lethargy, attachment, and congestion when stagnant. Stimulation, warmth, movement, and lightness are your medicine.',

      'Your constitution is naturally cool, heavy, and steady. You are strong, resilient, and grounded; your best balance comes from warming, lighter movement, quickening energy, and a little extra lift.',
